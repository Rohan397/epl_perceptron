# epl_perceptron
Pull match stats from epl games and run a simple perceptron to weight each stat's importance in a team winning a game!

Use: 

Existing functionality: 

run code every week after all games in the matchweek are played. Results and game stats for each team will be uploaded. 
If a team won the game the result is considered 1, otherwise it is 0.

Functionality to be added:

next steps are to build a simple perceptron that weights each stat and can be called upon to modify weights for any team - 
then it can uuse those weights to predict whether a team will win a game when dummy stats for the game are inputted.
